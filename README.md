# Experiments with Stable Diffusion

This repository is a fork of [Justin Pinkney's stable diffusion repository](https://github.com/justinpinkney/stable-diffusion).

It presents the use case of fine-tuning a text2image stable diffusion model with a [BLIP captioned naruto face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lambdalabs/naruto-blip-captions).

In this case, we generate Naruto style images from a text prompt:

<img src="./assets/outputv2_grid.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

> "Bill Gates with a hoodie", "John Oliver with Naruto style", "Hello Kitty with Naruto style", "Lebron James with a hat", "Mickael Jackson as a ninja", "Banksy Street art of ninja"

For a step by step guide see the [Lambda Labs examples repo](https://github.com/LambdaLabsML/examples).
